# musicmath

A demo of music and math (and programming)!

## Overview

Learning clojurescript and hopefully setup a demo about note frequencies and tuning incompatibilities.

## Setup

Get `lein`: [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

Once installed, run `lein repl` - the project.clj contains the deps and startup commands for running `figwheel` which compiles the .cljs files into .js and loads a server with hot-loading. The site is then usually accessible at `localhost:3449`.

Depending on what editor you use, you will have to look up how to incorporate clojure/clojurescript into your workflow.
